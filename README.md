## 🤖 Field and Service Robotics – Homeworks

### 🧍‍♂️ Homework 1 – Modeling & Actuation
- ✅ Analyzed actuation (full/under) of ATLAS, youBot, iiwa, etc.
- ⚙️ Computed DOFs and configuration spaces of spatial mechanisms.
- 🔄 Checked involutivity and computed distribution annihilators.
- 📐 Proved integrability of constant Pfaffian constraints.
- 🤖 Modeled Raibert hopper and analyzed holonomy.

### 🚲 Homework 2 – Unicycle & Bicycle Control
- 🧭 Planned trajectories using cubic polynomials with velocity constraints.
- 🎯 Designed controllers via linearization and polar regulation.
- 📊 Analyzed performance on complex paths (e.g., lemniscate) and control comparison (linear and nonlinar controllers).
